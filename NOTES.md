# Notes

These are just rough notes as I learn or discover something.

## Macro Assembler Syntax

Comments follow a `;`.

Global labels are defined with a following `::`.

`=` sets a **reassignable symbol** (i.e. variable)
`==` sets an **absolute symbol** (i.e. constant)

The `^O20000` on line 32 is octal (i.e. `8192` or `$2000`)

The `RADIX 10` on line 4 sets the default radix to 10.

`IFE` and `IFN` are conditional directives (IF Equal and IF Not equal respectively) and the general format is:

```
IFE condition,<code_to_assemble_if_true>
IFN condition,<code_to_assemble_if_false>
```

so the conditional code blocks are between angle brackets `<` `>` and can be nested (as seen in lines 36â€“39).

Notice the trick of something like `IFN REALIO-1` which is testing if `REALIO` equals `1` (because then `REALIO-1` would be zero/falsey).
